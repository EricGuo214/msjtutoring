        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="testing">
          Mission Tutoring is a website where students get paired with
          personalized tutors. Our goal is to create an environment where
          students struggling in certain areas can get the best assistance
          available from their peers. We have bridged the gap between students
          looking for help and tutors looking to assist.

                Hello! I am currently 16 years old and a junior at Mission San
                Jose High. I joined MSJ tutoring because I wanted to give people
                an opportunity to get help if they needed it. I wanted to spread
                my knowledge with the community. I hope that anyone who uses
                this website will find academic success. In my spare time I love
                to code and run.

                Nice to meet you! I created and led MSJ tutoring because I
                wanted to create a tool that would help struggling students and
                encourage kindness. With MSJ Tutoring, exceptional students are
                given the oppurtunity to gain experience in teaching and
                struggling students can learn from their successful peers. My
                hobbies are dancing, running, and playing the piano!

                Hey! I am currently 16 years old and a junior at Mission San
                Jose High. I joined MSJ tutoring because I love to spread my
                knowledge with other people. I didn't want there to be a barrier
                for people like me to not to be able to help and teach people.
                In my spare time I love to run and play sports, especially table
                tennis.

                I joined MSJ tutoring to improve Mission San Jose High School's
                student experiences in challenging courses. My goal is to
                develop a website that benefits all participants with meaningful
                experiences and a sense of community. I hope that everybody who
                uses this website achieves their desired results! I enjoy
                dancing, reading, and exercise.
