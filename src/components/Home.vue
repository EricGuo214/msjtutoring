       Hey! I am currenlt 16 years old and a junior at Mission San Jose High. I joined MSJ tutoring because I love to spread my knowledge with other people. I didn't want there to be a barrier
       for people like me to not to be able to help and teach people. In my spare time I love to run and play sports, especially table tennis.
